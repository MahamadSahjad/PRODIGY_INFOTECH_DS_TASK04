# Real-Time Sentiment Analysis on Tweets

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

This project analyzes the sentiment of tweets to determine whether they are **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques along with Python libraries to process and visualize tweet sentiments in an interactive and insightful way.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset contains tweets with textual content, which are preprocessed to remove noise like URLs, special characters, and stopwords before performing sentiment analysis.

---

## ðŸ›  Libraries Used

* **pandas** â€“ Data manipulation and cleaning
* **numpy** â€“ Numerical computations
* **matplotlib** â€“ Data visualization
* **seaborn** â€“ Statistical data visualization
* **wordcloud** â€“ Word cloud generation for visual insights
* **textblob** â€“ Sentiment analysis

---

## ðŸ”„ Workflow

1. **Import Libraries** â€“ Load required Python packages.
2. **Load Dataset** â€“ Read CSV dataset containing tweets.
3. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Remove unwanted characters, stopwords, and URLs.
4. **Sentiment Analysis** â€“ Use `TextBlob` to calculate polarity and classify sentiment.
5. **Visualization** â€“ Generate sentiment distribution charts and word clouds.
6. **Save Results** â€“ Export the processed dataset with sentiment labels.

---

## ðŸ“Š Results

* Sentiment classification: Positive, Negative, Neutral
* Polarity score for each tweet
* Visual representation of sentiment distribution
* Word clouds highlighting the most common words in each sentiment category

---

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

This project provides an end-to-end pipeline for performing **real-time sentiment analysis** on tweets. The workflow can be adapted for live streaming data using APIs like Tweepy for real-time monitoring.

---

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

* Integrate **Twitter API** for live tweet analysis
* Use advanced NLP models like **VADER** or **BERT** for better accuracy
* Deploy as a **Flask web application** for user interaction
